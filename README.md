This repo can be used as a sandbox to learn React. The [FullDemo](./components/full-demo/full-demo.component.tsx) component has everything you need to learn some of the well known React hooks. This repo is meant to be as minimal as possible.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
